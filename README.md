# Maze-Solver

Mazes are often simple puzzles for humans, but they present a great programming problem that we can solve using shortest-path techniques like [Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).
Here, I have implemented the same using python to solve mazes.

Have fun ! :smile:
